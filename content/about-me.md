## About me 😎

I'm Raffael ! I love working on new projects, either dev oriented or research oriented.

I'm fond of Artificial Intelligence, and in particular Reinforcement Learning ! 🤖

My goal is to understand intelligence one day, or at least to make an AI that looks intelligent 😝

## How to reach me 💌

It is easier to find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raffaelbdl/), see you soon ! 😉

## My current projects 🆘

Definitely too many pojects on going. My current goal is to learn as much as I can as a student.
